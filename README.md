# MERN Stack Project
WebApp using <strong>MongoDB-Express-React-NodeJS</strong> stack

## Summary
With this project we enable a social network aimed at developers. We will rely on React for the Front End and Express for the backend, both of them using current JavaScript techniques.

## FrontEnd
Front End is created with React, React Router and the new Context API from React.
